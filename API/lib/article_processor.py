from transformers import pipeline

"""
This class processes individual articles, 
extracting specified information and analyzing sentiment scores using a Transformer pipeline 
on combined titles and descriptions. 
Note: sentiment analysis is slow; consider a faster model based on our needs. 
With full access to a newsAPI key, particularly access to article content, sentiment scoring accuracy could improve. 
Articles are validated to prevent null results from deleted publications. 
Finally, articles are transformed into a delicious dictionary format, ready for use elsewhere.
