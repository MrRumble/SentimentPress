## Requirements

- NEWSAPI_KEY
- MONGODB_URL
- REDIS_HOST
- REDIS_PORT
- REDIS_DB
- REDIS_TEST_DB
- SECRET_KEY

## Redis Setup

- brew install redis
- set up a production db and test_tb

To switch between production DB and test DB in Redis Insight:
- SELECT 0   <- Production DB
- SELECT 1   <- Test DB

Make sure these are matched in your .env file.

## Performance Imrovements

To speed up the fetch_and_process_query function, which is slow because sentiment analysis is CPU-intensive, I first tried using multiprocessing. But since Hugging Faceâ€™s sentiment analysis already uses multiprocessing internally, adding more processes didnâ€™t help much. So, Iâ€™ve put fetch_and_process_query back to how it was and put a hold on further performance tweaks for now.
