## Performance Imrovements

To speed up the fetch_and_process_query function, which is slow because sentiment analysis is CPU-intensive, I first tried using multiprocessing. But since Hugging Faceâ€™s sentiment analysis already uses multiprocessing internally, adding more processes didnâ€™t help much. So, Iâ€™ve put fetch_and_process_query back to how it was and put a hold on further performance tweaks for now.
